## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd d:\gitcode\Projects\Unthinkable

# Activate venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Check if port 8000 is free
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F
```

### API returns 502 error

- Check your .env file has `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Verify API key is valid at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Check internet connection

### Frontend can't connect to API

- Make sure server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Try opening frontend via local server instead of file://

### No tasks generated

- Check server logs for errors
- Try with mock mode: set `SMART_TASK_PLANNER_MOCK=true` in .env
- Verify your goal is clear and specific
